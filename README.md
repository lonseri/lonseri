- 👋 Hi, I’m @lonseri
- 👀 I’m interested in learning data science and project management.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on an IBM data science certificate.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate - or am I?
- 📫 How to reach me ... is TBD.  Through GitHub?  I'm new at this and don't feel like sharing a private email address.
